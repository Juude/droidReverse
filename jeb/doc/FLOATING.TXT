> FLOATING LICENSES

Floating builds provide more flexibility than individual builds, and can be
distributed to many users within an organization.

Currently, only the Enterprise version of JEB2 supports floating licenses.

The client (referred to as "JEB") as well as the server (referred to as the
"Controller") are the same binary file: there is no separate package for the
Controller.

When starting, as well as during its execution, JEB will regularly probe the
Controller to determine whether or not it is allowed to run. This check is
based on the number of seats available in your licensed build: eg, a floating
license for 5 seats allows 5 different users to run JEB concurrently.

In order to start the Controller, use the '--controller' flag along with the
'-c' flag. Example, if the controller runs on a Linux machine:

  $ jeb_linux.sh -c --controller

In order to start JEB, proceed as usual, for instance on Windows:

  $ jeb_wincon.bat

Notes:
- The '--controller' flag is not available if the build is not a floating one.
- The Controller must be started before the clients.
- JEB instances regularly contact the Controller. Therefore, the Controller
  should always be reachable by running instances of JEB. In order to minimize
  potential problems due to network latency, it is recommended to run JEB and
  the Controller within the same local network.
- By default, the Controller listens on all interfaces, on port 23477. This
  can be changed by setting the '.ControllerInterface' and '.ControllerPort'
  flags the configuration file. Please refer to the manual for more information
  about the configuration file.
- The protocol used for communication between a Controller and JEB instances is
  HTTP, therefore eliminating potential firewall blocking issues.
- JEB instances and the Controller may be run in different environments (as in
  the example above: Controller on Linux, JEB on Windows, etc.)
